# Rabelo et al. The Influence of Vitoria Eddy in the abundance of seabob shrimp
## Overview
This repo cotains the data and Rmarkdown code for my manuscript: "The influence of Vitória Eddy in the abundance of seabob shrimp Xiphopenaeus spp. (Heller) in the brazilian east coast", which has been submitted to Regional Studies in Marine Science. The aim is to investigate how primary productivity and temperature translates to shrimp abundance.
